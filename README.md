# MDsmrt (Smart Medical Data)

This project covers the portability of patients scan images through the blockchain creating a
decentralised platform and analysing them through a convolutional neural network.

The idea of this project came from a combination of internships at MasterCard and Optum. Both
very different areas of software engineering as Mastercard is a worldwide payment processor,
whereas Optum powers modern health care to create a healthier world. Two of the main problems
in the health care system is the loss of data, such as MRI and CT scans, and the accurate reading
of these scans by doctors. Scan images are given to patients on a CD which are unreadable, and
can be lost very easily, meaning if you go to a new hospital or doctor your previous scan results
are unknown. My idea stemmed from here, if a doctor can see previous scan results of a patient
and accurately read them quickly, it will benefit both parties resulting in the saving of valuable time.
